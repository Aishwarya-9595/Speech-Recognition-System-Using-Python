# Speech-Recognition-System-Using-Python
I have developed an application where users can simply command the system with their voice and in response the system accomplishes its task.
I have used PyAudio package to take input and other packages in Python to implement other functionalities.

User can  ask to open different applications in system, ask any query he/she has, search on different platforms like Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and also system is able to wait for response from user and exit on your command.
